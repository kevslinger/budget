# Design Doc

The phases of this project will go as follows:

## Phase 1: Laying the Groundwork <-- (We are here)

Create the application, set up package/go mod/README/etc., plan out the design for the basic features (including I/O), push to go pkg.

## Phase 2: Building Funcionality

Execute the design and build the basic package in a simple and clear way.
At the most basic level, the app should ask you for your monthly income and monthly expenses, and report how much you saved at the end of the month.
In the next iteration, the user will be able to enter multiple incomes and multiple expenses, and the app will sum each stream and report how much is left at the end of the month.

## Phase 3: Polishing

Clean up the code to become more readable and elegant.

## Phase 4: Adding Features

Add to the current repo additional features that could be useful for users.
